The Euler discretization of the Langevin stochastic differential equation (SDE) is known to be unstable, when the potential U is superlinear. Based on previous works on the taming of superlinear drift coefficients for SDEs, we introduce the Tamed Unadjusted Langevin Algorithm (TULA) and obtain non-asymptotic bounds in V-total variation norm and Wasserstein distance of order 2 between the iterates of TULA and π, as well as weak error bounds. Numerical experiments are presented which support our findings."

	abstract = {Abstract Metropolized integrators for ergodic stochastic differential equations (SDEs) are proposed that (1) are ergodic with respect to the (known) equilibrium distribution of the SDEs and (2) approximate pathwise the solutions of the SDEs on finite-time intervals. Both these properties are demonstrated in the paper, and precise strong error estimates are obtained. It is also shown that the Metropolized integrator retains these properties even in situations where the drift in the SDE is nonglobally Lipschitz, and vanilla explicit integrators for SDEs typically become unstable and fail to be ergodic. © 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},,

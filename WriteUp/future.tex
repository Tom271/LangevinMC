There are many possible ways in which the work presented here could be extended, both from a research and personal perspective. 

-- Other methods (mMALA, HMC <- big one, SGLD, underdamped LD)\\
-- Apply to actual data, will affect performance as unbiassed estimators of the gradient have to be calculated\\
-- Parallelisation\\
Research: \\
-- tighten nonasymptotic bounds, get in terms of an implementable metric\\
-- develop methods to calculate 2-Wass\\

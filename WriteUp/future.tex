There are many possible ways in which the work presented here could be extended, both from a research and personal perspective. 

-- Test accuracy of our measures!!!!!
-- Other methods (mMALA, HMC <- big one, SGLD, underdamped LD)\\
-- Apply to actual data, will affect performance as unbiassed estimators of the gradient have to be calculated\\
-- Parallelisation\\
-- Non-smooth potentials (give Marcelo a citation \cite{durmus2018efficient})\\
-- Stiffness (give Kostas a citation too \cite{abdulle2013weak})\\
Research: \\
-- tighten nonasymptotic bounds, get in terms of an implementable metric\\
-- develop methods to calculate 2-Wass

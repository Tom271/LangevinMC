Monte Carlo methods are a class of algorithms that use repeated random sampling to calculate numerical approximations of integrals.

In this report we consider the problem of sampling from a distribution of the form
	$$
	\pi (x) \propto \exp(-U(x))
	$$
for some potential function $U$.  In statistical mechanics, this distributions is called a Gibbs distribution, and is often used to model the postions and velocities of particles in a gas.
